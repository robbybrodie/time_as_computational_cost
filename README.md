# Time as Computational Cost

This repository contains a working draft of a theoretical framework authored by **Robert Brodie** that proposes a computational model for understanding time, mass, gravity, and wavefunction collapse.

The central idea: **time is not fundamental**, but an emergent result of the **quantum gate complexity** required to resolve wavefunctions. This model provides a unifying perspective on quantum mechanics and relativity.
