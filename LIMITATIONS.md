# Limitations

## Scope and Intent

- Exploratory toy models and curve‑fitting; not a derivation or demonstration of physical law.

## Known Risks

- Curve fitting and parameter proliferation.
- Metric cherry‑picking and selection bias.
- Dependence on discretization and neighborhood connectivity.
- Confirmation bias and lack of independent validation.

## Mitigations

- Pre‑registration of hypotheses and evaluation protocols.
- Addition of simple baselines and model selection penalties (AIC/BIC, cross‑validation).
- Ablation studies and robustness checks.
- Held‑out tests and external replication.
