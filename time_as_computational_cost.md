# Time as Computational Cost: A Unified Framework for Quantum Evolution and Relativistic Effects

**Author: Robert Brodie**

## Abstract

This paper proposes a computational model in which time, mass, and gravity are not fundamental features of the universe, but emergent byproducts of the gate complexity required to resolve quantum waveforms. The model unifies principles from quantum mechanics, special and general relativity, and information theory by reframing time as the cost of computation, not a background parameter.

Under this framework, systems with greater waveform resolution complexity — due to velocity, gravitation, or entanglement — experience time dilation not because of motion or mass itself, but because more quantum gate operations are required to evolve them. Observable time becomes a function of local computational throughput. Mass is not a primitive input but a measure of persistent waveform complexity across localized regions of spacetime.

This reframing dissolves the distinction between quantum evolution and relativistic time dilation by viewing both as limits imposed by a finite-resolution gate mesh. Collapse, motion, and even black hole formation are recast as computational behaviors — all governed by the cost of resolving probability into observation.

## 1. Introduction

In classical physics, time is treated as a continuous dimension — an independent variable that flows uniformly for all observers. In quantum mechanics, it is not part of the wavefunction, but an external parameter used to describe unitary evolution. Both views rely on time as a *given*.

This model rejects that assumption. It proposes instead that **time is a local byproduct of computation**: the number of quantum gate operations required to resolve a system’s probabilistic state from one observable configuration to the next. 

Where relativity observes time dilation due to velocity or gravity, and quantum theory describes decoherence and collapse, this model unifies both phenomena as effects of **waveform resolution cost** across a finite computational substrate.

## 2. Quantum Gates and Emergent Time

Quantum systems evolve via unitary transformations — operations that can be decomposed into sequences of quantum gates. Each gate represents a fundamental interaction that refines the wavefunction’s state toward a future measurement.

We define:

- **Gate Complexity (G):** The number of quantum gate operations required to evolve a system from one observable state to another.
- **Observable Tick (T):** A point at which enough computation has occurred to allow a resolvable change from the perspective of some observer.

From this view:

- A system with low waveform complexity evolves quickly through observable ticks.
- A system with high waveform complexity evolves more slowly, because each tick requires more computational effort.

Time is not something the system *passes through*. It is the **accounting of how much compute was required to produce the next state** — from a particular observational frame.

## 3. Relativistic Effects as Computational Throttling

In special relativity, time slows down as objects approach the speed of light. In this model, that time dilation is a symptom of **increased waveform resolution complexity**: the moving system’s state spreads probabilistically over a larger portion of spacetime, requiring more gates to track and evolve.

More specifically:

- **Higher velocity** → broader waveform spread  
- **Broader spread** → more entangled resolution steps  
- **More gate steps** → longer compute time per tick  
- **Result**: The system experiences fewer ticks per Planck unit from an external observer’s frame

In general relativity, massive bodies appear to "bend" spacetime and slow time. In this model, **mass is not a cause but a consequence**: regions of concentrated waveform complexity produce increased gate density — effectively throttling local evolution.

Thus:

- **What we call gravity** is the observable result of waveform complexity gradients across space.
- **Time dilation near gravity wells** reflects the increased compute cost to evolve those systems.

Mass and gravitation are **computational bottlenecks**, not input parameters. Their effects on time follow from the gate burden required to keep them coherent.

## 4. Collapse, Measurement, and Gate Resolution

Wavefunction collapse is often treated as instantaneous and mysterious. In this model, collapse occurs when a sufficient number of gate operations resolve a system's entangled state into a definite observable configuration.

That is:

- **Collapse = computational completion of entanglement resolution**
- **Measurement = the moment when an external observer can resolve the system based on completed gate steps**
- **Delay in collapse = a difference in compute rates, not an absolute delay in time**

The key insight is that “observation” is not an external act. It is **a local computation by the global gate mesh**. From the frame of the observer, time passes until collapse is resolved. From the system's frame, the experience of time may differ — or even be absent — depending on how entangled it is with the rest of the mesh.

## 5. Implications

This model unifies several major phenomena under a single computational principle:

- **Time is not fundamental:** It emerges from the act of resolving waveforms via quantum computation.
- **Mass is not fundamental:** It reflects persistent waveform complexity and gate burden.
- **Gravity is not fundamental:** It is a manifestation of gradient differences in gate resolution density.
- **Time dilation:** Emerges whenever gate resolution cost increases — due to velocity, gravitation, or entanglement.
- **Speed of light limit:** Represents the fastest rate at which gate operations can propagate a causally consistent update through spacetime. It is not just a speed limit; it’s a **compute budget boundary**.
- **Black holes:** Represent local failure to resolve — a region where waveform complexity exceeds what the mesh can handle, triggering a sandboxing or isolation behavior.
- **Collapse paradoxes:** Are reframed as delays in gate resolution, not metaphysical jumps. What looks like “instantaneous” may be frame-relative compute alignment.

In this light, even **consciousness** might be understood as a self-resolving entangled waveform: a system whose subjective time depends entirely on its local access to gate compute.

## 6. Conclusion

Time, mass, and gravity are computational epiphenomena. They arise not because the universe *has* them, but because resolving the universe’s entangled waveform requires compute — and the burden of that compute limits what can be experienced, when, and by whom.

By reframing physics in terms of quantum gate resolution across a finite mesh, we gain a coherent explanatory framework that:

- Unifies relativistic and quantum time behavior
- Removes metaphysical assumptions about “flowing” time
- Provides concrete insight into the cost of observation and motion

Where time slows, compute intensifies. Where mass appears, gate density rises. Where entanglement collapses, resolution completes.

This model turns physics from a story of things moving through spacetime into a system of **resolution layers** that evolve probabilistically — at a cost.

## 7. Next Steps

Further work is required to formalize this model, but promising directions include:

- Modeling waveform evolution using gate-based simulators (e.g. Qiskit, Q#)
- Formal analysis via the Margolus-Levitin and Lloyd bounds on computation
- Developing testable predictions for collapse delays under extreme velocity or gravity
- Reframing the black hole information paradox as an encoding/compression problem
- Exploring whether subjective consciousness correlates with local compute availability across entangled systems

This model also suggests a deeper interpretation of quantum experiments: not as demonstrations of paradox, but as careful manipulations of gate resolution environments.
