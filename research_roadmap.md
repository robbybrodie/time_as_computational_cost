# Research Roadmap: From Fitted Model to Predictive Theory

## Current Status: Exploratory Curve‑Fitting Results

Current results are preliminary fits of simple mechanisms to selected GR benchmarks. These are exploratory curve-fitting experiments, not a derivation or demonstration of physical discovery. The exponential B(N) scaling (MSE ≈ 2.918) is a target for future validation and theoretical derivation.

**Milestones below are goals for validation and may falsify current mechanisms.**

## Phase 1: Derive B(N) from Bandgap Physics (Priority: Critical)

### 1.1 Fundamental Bandgap Theory
**Objective**: Derive exponential B(N) from substrate tension physics

**Approach**:
- Model substrate as network of coupled oscillators (strings/springs)
- Tension creates frequency-dependent bandgaps: ω_gap(T) = f(tension)
- Blocked modes → reduced effective metric scaling
- Target: B(N) = exp(-α(1-N)) where α emerges from bandgap width

**Key Equations to Derive**:
```
Tension tensor: T_μν = T_μν(ŝ, λ̂)
Bandgap frequency: ω_gap = ω_0 √(1 + βT)
Mode accessibility: n_accessible = ∫ ρ(ω) [1 - Θ(ω - ω_gap)] dω
Spatial scaling: B(N) = (n_accessible/n_total)^γ
```

**Timeline**: 2-3 months
**Deliverable**: First-principles B(N) derivation paper

### 1.2 Parameter Constraints
**Objective**: Eliminate free parameters using physical constraints

**Constraints**:
- Weak-field limit: B(N) → 1 + O(1-N) as N → 1
- Strong-field behavior: B(N) → exp(-α(1-N)) for N → 0
- Planck-scale cutoff: Maximum tension ~ M_Planck
- Causality: No superluminal modes

**Validation**: Compare derived α with experimental fit value

## Phase 2: Post-Newtonian Predictions (Priority: High)

### 2.1 Calculate PPN Parameters
**Objective**: Compute post-Newtonian parameters for tension bandgap mechanism

**Parameters to Calculate**:
- γ: Space curvature parameter
- β: Nonlinearity parameter  
- ξ: Preferred-frame effects
- α₁, α₂: Preferred-location effects

**Method**:
- Expand B(N) = exp(-α(1-N)) in weak field
- Compare with standard PPN metric
- Identify deviations from GR (γ=β=1, others=0)

**Expected Result**: Quantitative predictions to be validated or falsified by future analysis and data

### 2.2 Gravitational Wave Dispersion
**Objective**: Predict frequency-dependent GW propagation

**Key Prediction**: 
```
v_group(ω) = c[1 - δ(ω/ω_gap)²]
```
where δ ~ α × field strength

**Observational Test**: LIGO/Virgo chirp analysis for dispersion

## Phase 3: Falsifiable Predictions (Priority: High)

### 3.1 Black Hole Spectroscopy
**Objective**: Predict spectral distortions near event horizons

**Mechanism**: Bandgaps create frequency-dependent redshift
**Signature**: Missing spectral lines at characteristic frequencies
**Target**: Event Horizon Telescope observations

### 3.2 Neutron Star Constraints
**Objective**: Test strong-field regime predictions

**Observables**:
- Pulse timing variations with frequency
- Gravitational wave chirp modifications
- X-ray spectral distortions

**Constraint**: Bandgap effects must not violate existing NS observations

### 3.3 Laboratory Analogues
**Objective**: Test bandgap formation in controlled systems

**Systems**:
- Metamaterial networks under tension
- Phononic crystals with tunable bandgaps
- Cold atom optical lattices

**Measurement**: Effective "time dilation" via mode blocking

## Phase 4: Hybrid Mechanisms (Priority: Medium)

### 4.1 Bandgaps + Causal Diamond
**Objective**: Combine best features of both mechanisms

**Approach**:
- Bandgaps provide frequency selectivity
- Diamond throttling provides volume scaling
- Combined: B(N) = B_bandgap(N) × B_diamond(N)

**Advantage**: May improve MSE further and provide richer phenomenology

### 4.2 Mode Crowding Fix
**Objective**: Correct baseline normalization issue

**Problem**: Γ_rest = 2.439 ≠ 1.000
**Solution**: Renormalize mode counting or add baseline correction
**Goal**: Enable fair comparison with other mechanisms

## Phase 5: Computational Implementation (Priority: Medium)

### 5.1 Full Substrate Simulation
**Objective**: Implement complete substrate network dynamics

**Features**:
- 3D voxel network with realistic connectivity
- Dynamic bandgap formation under load
- Self-consistent metric evolution
- Comparison with GR solutions

### 5.2 Phenomenology Calculator
**Objective**: Tool for computing observational signatures

**Inputs**: Source parameters (mass, spin, distance)
**Outputs**: 
- Modified GW waveforms
- Spectral distortions
- Timing residuals
- PPN parameter values

## Risk Assessment

## Conclusion

Current results are exploratory and subject to validation. The tension bandgap mechanism provides a promising fit to selected benchmarks, but all claims are preliminary and require rigorous testing. The next phases will focus on independent validation, baseline comparisons, and falsifiable predictions.

**Note:** All mechanisms and hypotheses are tentative and may be falsified by forthcoming evaluation and data.
