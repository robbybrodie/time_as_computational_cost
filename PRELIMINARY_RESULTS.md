# Preliminary Results — Exploratory Fits to GR Benchmarks

## Scope

- This document summarizes preliminary curve‑fitting results obtained by tuning simple mechanisms within a discrete substrate to approximate selected Schwarzschild benchmarks. These results are not a derivation of GR and do not constitute physical evidence.

## Summary

- Best in‑framework fit so far: tension‑induced bandgaps with an exponential scaling form; example MSE ~2.918 on selected targets under fixed conditions.
- Comparative fits: causal diamond (~5.570), mode crowding (~7.432; normalization pending).

## Caveats

- Multiple free parameters; risk of overfitting.
- No baseline comparisons yet; no AIC/BIC/CV reported.
- Limited scenario diversity; internal validation only.
- Dependence on discretization and neighborhood connectivity not characterized.

## Planned evaluation upgrades

- Baselines + AIC/BIC; k‑fold CV/held‑out tests; ablations/sensitivity.
- Robustness to discretization/connectivity; uncertainty estimates (bootstrap).
- Mapping to effective metric components and preliminary PPN estimates with uncertainties.

## Next steps

- See VALIDATION_PLAN.md for pre‑registered hypotheses and acceptance criteria.
