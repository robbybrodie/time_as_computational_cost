# Predictions

## PPN Parameter Estimates

- PPN γ, β estimates from effective metric fits (target GR: γ=β=1).
- Report uncertainties and tolerances for each.
- Explicit pass/fail thresholds for agreement with GR.

## Classical Tests

- Light deflection vs impact parameter (solar and strong-field).
- Shapiro delay (radar echo time delay).
- Gravitational redshift.
- Perihelion precession of Mercury and other bodies.

## Gravitational Wave Dispersion

- GW group velocity as a function of frequency: explicit functional form and thresholds.
- Compare to LIGO/Virgo data; specify what would falsify the mechanism.

## Falsifiability

- For each prediction, specify the result or threshold that would falsify the mechanism.
- Reference public datasets and analysis protocols.
